Positive values are positive thrust, negative values are negative thrust.</field>

       <description>The RAW values of the RC channels sent to the MAV to override info received from the RC radio. A value of UINT16_MAX means no change to that channel. A value of 0 means control of that channel should be released back to the RC radio. The standard PPM modulation is as follows: 1000 microseconds: 0%, 2000 microseconds: 100%. Individual receivers/transmitters might violate this specification.</description>
