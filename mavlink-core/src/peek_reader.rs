//! This module implements a buffered/peekable reader.
//!
//! The purpose of the buffered/peekable reader is to allow for backtracking parsers.
//!
//! A reader implementing the standard library's [`std::io::BufRead`] trait seems like a good fit, but
//! it does not allow for peeking a specific number of bytes, so it provides no way to request
//! more data from the underlying reader without consuming the existing data.
//!
//! This API still tries to adhere to the [`std::io::BufRead`]'s trait philosophy.
//!
//! The main type `PeekReader`does not implement [`std::io::Read`] itself, as there is no added benefit
//! in doing so.
//!
